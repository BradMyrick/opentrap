 * <p>The defaults follow the shape of a scan: the crawl's pages and everything
 * done by hand are kept in full, the audit's own probe traffic is kept as
 * headers only (every finding already carries its full request and response),
 * and the probe traffic held in memory during a session is capped so a long
 * audit cannot grow the heap without limit.
